"""
Contains functions which perform serial communication with arduino.
Functions:
-setup                set up the serial connection
-disconnect           close the serial connection
-m1                   drive first motor (fresh media)
-m2                   drive second motor (waste media)
-m3                   drive third motor (ligand )
